# EmpowerSoC-Tool
We have built an open-source EDA tool, EmpowerSoC, that can be used for power estimation of SoC. It has been developed alongside the existing QFlow open-source tool chain. The emerging trend in applications for the ever increasing functionality, performance and integration within SoC is leading to designs that dissipate power in huge amounts and hence it has become essential to keep an eye at the amount of power dissipation while designing a SoC. This makes the EmpowerSoC a useful tool for the researchers who wish to put forward new low power designs.

-> Kindly go through the tutorial provided to familiarise yourself with the tool.

-> You can check out the detailed documentation provided to know more about the tool and its working.

-> A sample 180nm model parameters file is also included for reference.

   Note: If you want to use your own model parameters, kindly ensure the library name and model name are same as the one in sample model file provided.
